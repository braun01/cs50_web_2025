Slides from section can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bmAfoRCbruUtq9lxbmf27HV47h2OxgxS0T_EcDbsxx0/edit?usp=sharing).

### Goal

Make a Django project with one sub app that displays your age on one page, and gets your age on another via a form.

To make a new Django project, run `django-admin startproject PROJECT_NAME` in the appropriate directory.

To make a new app, run `python manage.py startapp APP_NAME`.

To start your project, run `python manage.py runserver`.

**Note:** You might have to install the `dateutil` Python module.

## Section 1: HTML, CSS + SASS, Python & Git

### HTML & DOM Mini Activity: Goal

Familiarize yourself with the structure of a webpage. Take a look at the image in `section1/html_dom_activity/activity/html_activity_screenshot.png` and try to:

1.  Recreate the HTML
2.  Draw out the DOM tree

### About Me Activity: Goal

Starter files are in the `section1/` directory.

Make a simple HTML page about yourself. Your page should include the following:

-   Your name
-   Two fun facts
-   At least 3 pictures (can be of anything)
-   A link to your favorite Google search

You should include but are not limited to the following html tags:

-   \<h1\>
-   \<li\>
-   \<img\>
-   \<a\>

In styles/style.scss, write some styles to make your page look a little nicer. **Bonus points** if you use flexbox or boostrap on top of your own styles. Remember to compile your SCSS (or watch the file) to pick up updates.
