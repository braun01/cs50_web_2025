# CSCI 33-a, Athena's Section

Activities and their solutions for Athena Braun's 2025 CSCI 33-a Section.

## Week 1: HTML, CSS + SASS, Python & Git

Starter files are in the `section1/` directory.
Slides from section can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iUx2GvqXVAplir9XyqwtCR2qoVmLpDyDuUumAv5JHU8/edit?usp=sharing).

### Goal

Make a simple HTML page about yourself. Your page should include the following:

-   Your name
-   Two fun facts
-   At least 3 pictures (can be of anything)
-   A link to your favorite Google search

You should include but are not limited to the following html tags:

-   h1
-   li
-   img
-   a

In styles/style.scss, write some styles to make your page look a little nicer. **Bonus points** if you use flexbox or boostrap on top of your own styles.
